Hello World,

We proudly present you Trackfellas,  a revolutionary community-based platform for travel routes.

Individual travel is our shared passion. However planning individual trips is a huge hassle. You find nowadays lots of information about certain places, but the biggest problem is to link a chosen destination to a travel route. For that travelers still have to rely on printed guidebooks to plan their best route. Most individual travelers face this problem, either before or during their travels. So far there no solution exists, which allows travelers to upload their own travel route, rate their experiences or find routes of others. Their knowledge remains mainly restricted to their friends or gets buried in one of countless travel blogs.

After planning trips all over the world, Moritz had the idea of building a community-based platform for travel routes. Together with Niklas and Lucas we dug deeper into solving the problem and devised a unified solution for traveler needs.

Starting from discovering routes of other travelers, to planning your own travel route on a map, booking certain parts of your journey, documenting your trip, rating your experiences and sharing it on social media and within the community, Trackfellas offers everything you need in one place. Now comes the best thing, we will offer all that as a free service with perfect usability.

Eventually we will develop a marketplace for individual trips, where routes and itineraries created by travelers are matched with personalized travel packages crafted by travel agencies.

Until then we can offer you a beta version of [trackfellas.com](http://trackfellas.com), we will keep you-up-to-date about Trackfellas, our development and news in our blog. We will also feed you with travel stories, exclusive travel tips and much more that makes you want to grab your backpack.

If you want to help us grow, give us some feedback in the comments, sign up for our newsletter and spread the word.

See you,

Team trackfellas
