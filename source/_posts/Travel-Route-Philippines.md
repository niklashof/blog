**Comment:** Cheap flight, but not the best connection and departure time as you fly during the day and arrive in the middle of the night to  Beijing. Possibility to get a 72-hour Visa-free transit in Beijing; Visited the city center and the forbidden city. You can get cheap there by train and metro. Alternatively you can visit the Great Wall of China within a half day tour from the airport as well. When travelling in winter make sure you have warm clothes as Beijing can become very cold.
**Tip:** Taxi trips from the airport can be really expensive, so better count and negotiate twice.
